About Me
======
I'm a computational cosmologist, working on various probes of fundamental physics. I am a member of the UNIONS (Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey) and Euclid collaborations.

I was born in Liverpool in the UK, did my undergraduate degree in Lancaster, and went to the University of Edinburgh for my PhD. I completed a Leverhulme Study Abroad Scholarship at the University of Waterloo during my PhD program. I have been rock climbing from a young age, using it as an excuse to travel and get outdoors when I can. I also enjoy squash, swimming, reading and music.
