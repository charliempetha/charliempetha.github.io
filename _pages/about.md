About Me
======
I'm a computational cosmologist, working on different probes of fundamental physics. I am a member of the UNIONS (Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey) and Euclid collaborations.

I was born in Liverpool in the UK, completed my undergraduate degree in Lancaster, and went to the University of Edinburgh for my PhD. I completed a Leverhulme Study Abroad Scholarship at the University of Waterloo during my PhD program. I have been rock climbing from a young age, using it as an excuse to travel and get outdoors when I can. I also enjoy squash, swimming, reading and music.

Weak lensing of gravitational waves
---------------

Just like light, graviational waves created by the merger of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) are weakly lensed as they propogate through the Universe, from thir source to us. The causes a (de-)magnification of their wave amplitude. If this is not properly accounted for, it can result in a bias on cosmoloigcal parameters inferred from gravitational wave *standard sirens*. I have investigated wether present approaches to dealing with this bias are sufficient. The figure below shows that, even after including a weak lensing uncertainty taken from the literature, the bias on parameters remains. More work is needed to correctly model the effect of weak lensing.

*641 gravitational wave standard sirens observed with a combination of third generation gravitaitonal wave detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic explorer, are used to constrain the dimensionless expansion rate h, and the matter density parameter. In the unlensed case, each source experiences no lensing. In the lensed case, the lensing is drawn from predictions for the weak lensing magnification distribtuion, and an estimated weak lensing uncertainty is applied to each source. The industry-standard weak lensing uncertainty correction has underestimated the effect, and a bias on parameters remains.* | *caption*


Gravitational redshifting
---------------

Light from galaxies in clusters is redshifted as it escapes the clusters substantial potential well. The size of this gravitational redshifting depends on the theory of gravity. Spectroscopic redshift measurements of galaxies and their host clusters centre can be used to measure the size of this effect as a function of radius.

I used data from the SPIDERS (SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources) cluster catalogue for a positive detection of gravitational redshifting. Better data is needed for this to constrain the theory of gravity.
