# I am a final-year graduate student at the University of Edinburgh. I have completed ... . My work focuses on investigating how present and future astronomical datasets can be leveraged in novel ways to maximise the extracted cosmological information. I am a member of the UNIONS and Euclid collaborations. In UNIONS I look at weak lensing profiles of galaxy clusters to probe cosmology. In Euclid I will be involved with using 2D and 3D profiles of clusters to probe cosmology. I also will lead a Standard Project looking at the gravitational redshifting of light from galaxies in clusters to test the theory of gravity.
