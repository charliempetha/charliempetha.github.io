About Me
======
I'm a computational cosmologist, working on different probes of fundamental physics.


Research
======

Infall region of galaxy clusters:
---------------



Weak lensing of gravitational waves:
---------------


Gravitational redshifting:
---------------

Light from galaxies in clusters is redshifted as it escapes the clusters substantial potential well. The size of this gravitational redshifting depends on the theory of gravity. Spectroscopic redshift measurements of galaxies and their host clusters centre can be used to measure the size of this effect as a function of radius.

I used data from the SPIDERS clsuter catalogue for a positive detection of gravitational redshifting. Better data is needed for this to constrain the theory of gravity.
